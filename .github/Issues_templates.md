Issue.
### Why?
> Very briefly, why we need to do this task?
> Answering this question will allow us to have a better context and will allow to improve focus, think over possible constraints and establish a successful outcome. 

### Description
> Specify what information do the assignee need to start the task 
> Use verbs to describe what we need to do and what should be the final product of those actions.

### Start Criteria
> Specify the preconditions and precedent tasks we must satisfy in order to start this task.
> Usually tasks are dependant on other tasks to finish, so we should specify when are we able to start doing the task.

### Completion Criteria
> If the task is composed of a set of activities we have to perform, write a checklist of the result of the activities we must perform so we can track task completion until we achieve the task final product.
